# Deep-Learning-HRTEM-Images-Gold-Nanoparticles


This repository contains the codes to implement a Deep Learning framework to predict the 3D structure of gold nanoparticles represented in a 2D view in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images. The codes provided in this repository have been developed for a project about Computer Vision and Deep Learning applied to microscopy images of advanced materials at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The results illustrated in this repository are part of the paper "Atomic column heights detection in metallic nanoparticles using deep convolutional learning" published in the Computational Materials Science journal:
